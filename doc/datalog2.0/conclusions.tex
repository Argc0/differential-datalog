\section{Conclusion and future work}\label{sec-conclusions}

DDlog is a young project.  The language is evolving quickly, driven by
the use cases.  We place paramount importance on language usability;
this is why we have enhanced Datalog with many non-traditional
constructs.  Our goal is to reduce as much as possible the need to
transition between multiple languages when writing large projects.
