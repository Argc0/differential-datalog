\section{Conclusion and future work}\label{sec-conclusions}

We demonstrated that DDlog makes it easy to develop incremental algorithms, offering dramatic
improvements in code size, complexity and performance.

In order to strengthen the case for programming control plane software
in DDlog, we are currently applying it to a variety of different
control plane tasks including building a complete virtual network
controller implementation; specifically, we are porting the
control-plane of the OVN open-source virtual network
controller~\cite{ovn} to DDlog.
